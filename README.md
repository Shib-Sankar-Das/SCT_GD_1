## Task Description
The first task assigned to me was to create digital posters or flyers for a public relations or marketing campaign for any brand or awareness campaign. To accomplish this, I conceptualized an imaginary soft drinks brand called **"FRUiTiX"**. FRUiTiX is a brand that sells natural, no-added-preservative soft drinks.

## Project Details

FRUiTiX is envisioned as a brand offering a range of natural soft drinks with no added preservatives. The brand aims to promote a healthy lifestyle while delivering delicious and refreshing beverages. The target audience for FRUiTiX includes health-conscious individuals and families looking for natural drink options.

3. **Visual Elements**: I incorporated images of fruits and natural elements to emphasize the brand's core values. The positioning of these elements was carefully considered to create a balanced and visually appealing design.

### Tools and Resources
1. **Design Software**: I used Canva to create the digital poster.
2. **Mockup Resources**: I discovered various online resources for mockups, which allowed me to present the poster in a realistic and professional manner.
